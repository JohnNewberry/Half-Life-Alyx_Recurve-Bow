# Half Life: Alyx - Recurve Bow

This is the code I wrote for a custom bow, useable in the Half Life: Alyx campaign.

It can be a bit messy in places but there are plenty of features and workarounds that could transferrable for other addons.

Keep in mind this is only the code, so you can see how it works. No additional assets are included in this repo right now; textures, models, prefabs etc.

The entire mod can be downloaded here:
